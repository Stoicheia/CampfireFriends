  Lines:
  - Hello fellow camper!
  - Bear told me you're a natural at scavenging the forest.
  - I actually want some food myself, can you gather some for me?
  - I could collect it myself, but I'm busy with... other things...
  - I want ACORNS, CHERRIES and BUGS. But don't bring me any of that other junk.
    Good luck!
