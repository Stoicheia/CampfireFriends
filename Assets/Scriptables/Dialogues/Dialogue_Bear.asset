  Lines:
  - Hello fellow camper!
  - I want some food for our camping party tonight, but...
  - You see, I'm too scared to go into the forest alone.
  - Can you help me, fellow camper?
  - To gather stuff, just follow the rhythm of the forest!
  - I want FISH, HONEY and FLOWERS. But don't bring me any other junk. Good luck!
